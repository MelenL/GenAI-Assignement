1. one image per story
the image is a tiny, abstract clue, not a full scene
no objects that reveal the solution
it should make sense only after the solution is known

2. music
background music only
dark, ambient, minimal
no lyrics
no recognizable instruments that suggest a place or time
loops well, low volume
emotional tone changes intensity (more soft / more sharp), not theme

3. emotional tone
emotional tone is internal only
affects the writing style of the scenario, not the plot
image/music intensity might change slightly (softer/sharper)
tone must never give clues
